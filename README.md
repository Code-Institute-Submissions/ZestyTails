## Introduction

This website is created for the cocktail aficionados and individuals who want to give a little spice to their 
events by having a cocktail bar, which provides a unique experience for their guests.
What we want to achieve with this website is to impart the knowledge of our experienced mixologists and also 
show the fun and excitement that can be had in the cocktail industry. We hope to help create new professional 
bartenders and also to ease the mind of people who think cocktail making is complicated, bringing the experience 
into their own home and showing them how much fun it is to experiment with common items around the house.

The website will provide information about the events this business can provide, make bar suggestions every month, 
explain what are some of the bar tools everyone should have. The website will also provide cocktail recipes, 
suggestions to try out, together with links to the best online stores and high-street retailers to get the 
ingredients they need. There will be a contact page, where users can contact the team for inquiries about 
collaborations and events.

A future events page will provide information about the participation at expos and cocktail experiences where 
individuals can meet the team and try out some of their cocktails. We hope that the testimonials added on the 
website will help build the trust in the ZestyTails company.

## UX

### Website Goals

* Share information about cocktail making.
* Provide information about what the events team does and at what price.
* Provide information about who is in the team and feedback from events they have hosted.
* Provide easy access to all the information, and links that are easily found.
* Provide the same experience accessing the website from a browser or mobile.
* Provide information about great bars and liquor stores to try out.
* Provide a contact form so individuals get in contact with the team easily, and receive a response in a timely 
    manner.
* Provide information about where the team can be met and how people can try out their cocktails before hiring 
    them for their events.
* Provide clearer feedback to users by altering the button/link colours when clicked.

### User Stories

    without loosing interest because of the waiting time.
* As a user, I want to see a website with warm and blending colours, with a functional and easy to use, intuitive 
    layout. 
* As a user, I want the website to have a consistent experience.
* As a user, I want to feel that I can come back for new content and not be presented with the same old information.
* As a user, I want to be able to contact the team easily, if I have more questions.
* As a user, I want the website to look credible and trustworthy.
* As a user, I want to see responsive buttons, so I know that an action was taken when I clicked a button. 
* As a user, I want to see a navigation bar that can lead to other pages. 
* As a user, I want to find information about the team, so I can understand how they came up with this idea and how 
    much it means to them.

### Design Choices

* **Fonts chosen**: Lato and Open Sans because they are easy to read and have a friendly, _summery_ appearance - as 
    described by [its authors](https://blog.prototypr.io/top-10-ui-fonts-for-web-mobile-a8488e561ce3), which go hand 
    in hand with the _summery_ vibe of cocktails.
* **Colours chosen**: translucent grey, blue, bronze/orange. Blue and bronze are some of the most predominant colours 
    in cocktail drinks and photos. Gray was chosen as a background colour for the pages where there is a heavy use of 
    bright colours, to create a good contrast and not overwhelm the visitor of the website.
  * Certain websites [based on the psychology of colour and conversions](https://neilpatel.com/blog/psychology-of-color-and-conversions/) 
    mention:
    * Blue: _“The colour blue is a colour of trust, peace, order, and loyalty.”_
    * Bronze /Orange: _“orange helps to “stimulate physical activity, competition, and confidence. Amazon.com uses 
        orange in their “limited time offer” banner. The colour suggests urgency, which makes the message more noticeable
        and actionable.”_
* **Layout chosen**: intuitive, easy to navigate, with a menu available in the header and footer and also a back to top 
    button in the footer to facilitate the website browsing. Using photos with human interaction as a background image 
    to evoke emotion. Buttons will have a hover effect so the users knows an action was taken when the button is clicked. 
    The burger menu icon will replace the standard navigation buttons when in tablet and mobile screen sizes to give a 
    cleaner look to the interface when users are browsing.
* **Content hinting**: will lead the user to discovery more about what the website offers - this is based on the video 
    from the _“It's All About The User Experience > The Structure Plane > Interaction Design (IXD)”_ from this course.

### Wireframes

As part of the development process I created 11 wireframes for my website (5 desktop pages, 5 mobile versions and 1 home
ipad version) using the [Balsamiq tool](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/#). These wireframes were created 
at the start of the projest, to help create a clear image of the website I want to build and also to be used as a 
planner for the project management.
* The contact form response page was created last, and it was a last minute decision, therefore the wireframe has not been built for it.
* This is the [**PDF version of the wireframes**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bozIMADexjemmPHJ5aN11zCDk14R9F4X/view?usp=sharing).
* This is the [**.png mobile version of the wireframes**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tNrL2QYCS2FOnRMCfZtdLwvxFXWTAXA0?usp=sharing).
* This is the [**.png desktop version of the wireframes**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LqQe9yraHVccuDF2AwpZwSq93C0blkdU?usp=sharing).
* This is the [**.png ipad home page version of the wireframe**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Za4U2RYRycCt8yeCh0xQyVZxaeclWhNe?usp=sharing).
* These wireframes are also stored in the [wireframes directory](https://github.com/anabear/ZestyTails/blob/4ccce0fa4d76c44e1c188472a322804f0bbb97f6/wireframes).
