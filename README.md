## Introduction

This website is created for the cocktail aficionados and individuals who want to give a little spice to their 
events by having a cocktail bar, which provides a unique experience for their guests.
What we want to achieve with this website is to impart the knowledge of our experienced mixologists and also 
show the fun and excitement that can be had in the cocktail industry. We hope to help create new professional 
bartenders and also to ease the mind of people who think cocktail making is complicated, bringing the experience 
into their own home and showing them how much fun it is to experiment with common items around the house.

The website will provide information about the events this business can provide, make bar suggestions every month, 
explain what are some of the bar tools everyone should have. The website will also provide cocktail recipes, 
suggestions to try out, together with links to the best online stores and high-street retailers to get the 
ingredients they need. There will be a contact page, where users can contact the team for inquiries about 
collaborations and events.

A future events page will provide information about the participation at expos and cocktail experiences where 
individuals can meet the team and try out some of their cocktails. We hope that the testimonials added on the 
website will help build the trust in the ZestyTails company.

### Design Choices

* **Fonts chosen**: Lato and Open Sans because they are easy to read and have a friendly, _summery_ appearance - as 
    described by [its authors](https://blog.prototypr.io/top-10-ui-fonts-for-web-mobile-a8488e561ce3), which go hand 
    in hand with the _summery_ vibe of cocktails.
* **Colours chosen**: translucent grey, blue, bronze/orange. Blue and bronze are some of the most predominant colours 
    in cocktail drinks and photos. Gray was chosen as a background colour for the pages where there is a heavy use of 
    bright colours, to create a good contrast and not overwhelm the visitor of the website.
  * Certain websites [based on the psychology of colour and conversions](https://neilpatel.com/blog/psychology-of-color-and-conversions/) 
    mention:
    * Blue: _“The colour blue is a colour of trust, peace, order, and loyalty.”_
    * Bronze /Orange: _“orange helps to “stimulate physical activity, competition, and confidence. Amazon.com uses 
        orange in their “limited time offer” banner. The colour suggests urgency, which makes the message more noticeable
        and actionable.”_
* **Layout chosen**: intuitive, easy to navigate, with a menu available in the header and footer and also a back to top 
    button in the footer to facilitate the website browsing. Using photos with human interaction as a background image 
    to evoke emotion. Buttons will have a hover effect so the users knows an action was taken when the button is clicked. 
    The burger menu icon will replace the standard navigation buttons when in tablet and mobile screen sizes to give a 
    cleaner look to the interface when users are browsing.
* **Content hinting**: will lead the user to discovery more about what the website offers - this is based on the video 
    from the _“It's All About The User Experience > The Structure Plane > Interaction Design (IXD)”_ from this course.

### Wireframes

As part of the development process I created 11 wireframes for my website (5 desktop pages, 5 mobile versions and 1 home
ipad version) using the [Balsamiq tool](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/#). These wireframes were created 
at the start of the project, to help create a clear image of the website I want to build and also to be used as a 
planner for the project management.

Some of the details that show on the wireframes were changed during the process of building the website because of accessibility 
and better visual. 
* These changes are:
  * On the page 'Tips & tricks' the 3rd section has been removed, because there was enough content for this page and similar
    suggestions would be available on the 'Recipes' page. 
  * Another visible change is the way the footer looks and is positioned. 'Back to top' button is positioned now above the footer,
    on top of the the social media icons and logo. Logo and icones positioned in the middle of the footer, have on the left the menu 
    and on the right the contact details. The footer looks more clear and well defined.
  * The contact form response page was created last, and it was a last minute decision, therefore the wireframe has not been built for it.
  
* This is the [**PDF version of the wireframes**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bozIMADexjemmPHJ5aN11zCDk14R9F4X/view?usp=sharing).
* This is the [**.png mobile version of the wireframes**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tNrL2QYCS2FOnRMCfZtdLwvxFXWTAXA0?usp=sharing).
* This is the [**.png desktop version of the wireframes**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LqQe9yraHVccuDF2AwpZwSq93C0blkdU?usp=sharing).
* This is the [**.png ipad home page version of the wireframe**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Za4U2RYRycCt8yeCh0xQyVZxaeclWhNe?usp=sharing).
* These wireframes are also stored in the [wireframes directory](https://github.com/anabear/ZestyTails/blob/4ccce0fa4d76c44e1c188472a322804f0bbb97f6/wireframes).

  * The Colour Contrast Check Tool allowed me to specify a foreground and a background colour and determine if 
    they provide enough of a contrast "when viewed by someone having color deficits or when viewed on a 
    black and white screen".
* [Monosnap](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/monosnap/lhgadannddhdpkfhfjjgcpdjhpmjhkfm?hl=en)

### Framework

* [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  * The project used BootStrap to help design the website structure, navigation menu, responsive columns, forms 
    and buttons.

### Testing tools

* I used [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) through the whole process of building the website, 
    to help me test the responsiveness, as I was building up every page and section, and to fix any issues that occured in this process.
    Used [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/) to also check how the
    website performs on all device sizes.
* Used the [Auto-prefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to make sure the css has all prefixes it needs, in order to work properly on
    all modern browsers.

* Used often [Unicorn Revealer Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unicorn-revealer/lmlkphhdlngaicolpmaakfmhplagoaln?hl=en-GB) 
    to help me locate overflow issues during the process of building the website.
* Used [Lighthouse Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk/related?hl=en) 
    to help me audit the website's performance, accessibility, check for quality improvements and help reduce loading time.
* Used [mobiReady](https://ready.mobi/) to test website performance on different devices.
* Used photo editor [Befunky](https://www.befunky.com/) to help me resize photos, while keeping a good resolution.

## Testing

   1. Tested the website on multiple browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge. It works good on Chrome, Firefox and Edge, also looking good
    on Android - all browsers, but on Iphone8 - IOS 13.3 the background image is extra zoomed in on all browsers.

   1. Tested the website on different screens sizes by using [Responsivedesign](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) and 
    [Responsivedesignchecker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/checker.php) and I have found the following:
      1. The website is responsive on all devices. 
      1. The layout changes as predicted, the menu transforms into a burger menu on small devices and pictures resize according to the device size. 
      1. There is a good visual over the text and buttons and there is enough space between text and sides of the screen. 
      1. Loading time is fast, the website is easy to navigate. 
      1. The background image zooms in ok on smaller devices, and renders the slogan and buttons clear and visible.     

   1. I entered my html code, each page at a time, on the [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) page, through **Validate by direct input**, clicked
    on **Check** and I have found the following:
      1. **Home** - shown that iframe needs adjustment regarding frameborder, overflow and text of the youtube video, adjusted suggested changes by removing
    the frameborder, the overflow property and the text.
      1. **Home** - *the 'back to top' button cannot appear as a descendant of an **a** element* - I therefore removed the **button** and styled the bootstrap 
    **btn** within the **a** element. Adjusted this on all pages.
      1. **Recipes** - *Element **lh** not allowed as child of element **ul** in this context* - I used **lh** as I have seen it
    [on the w3.org website, here](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/bulletlists.html). Adjusted this, by modifying the title, to become an **h6** with a class
    of 'subtitle', inside a **div**.
      1. **Contact** - I had to modify the contact form bootstrap code in order to adhere to the validator's requests. Input type was not accepted.  

   1. I validated my css code on the [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) page, by clicking on **By direct input** and adding the full css code
    from my *style.css*, clicked on **Check** and I have found the following:
      1. Had to adjust the 'navbar-toggler' border unit.
      1. There are several warnings (34), but these are all the changes made by [Auto-prefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to make sure the css has all prefixes
    it needs, in order to work properly on all modern browsers.

   1. I proceeded with the [Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk/related?hl=en) audit by adding the extension
    to my Chrome browser, clicking on the extension icon, and next clicking on **Generate report** button within the browser extension, once I was
    [on the homepage of my website](https://github.com/anabear/ZestyTails). Based on the audit, I was able to improve the following:
      1. Reduced photos size when available. Reduced about us image and the logo transparent image sizes, but did not reduce the hero image as I want it to have a 
    clear and neat resolution on all devices.
      1. Added a title to the 'iframe' video for accessibility.

   1. Tested the website on [mobiReady](https://ready.mobi/) by adding the website's URL in the main box on the website's main page and clicking on **Go**. 
      1. Some errors shown on [mobiReady](https://ready.mobi/) while testing were in relation to frames, css measurements and image resizing which could not be corrected as they 
    are required for the website functionality. [Screenshot of the test scan can be seen here](https://screenshot.click/31_53-vozy0-bdc45.png).

### Stories

* *As a user, I want to see a website that has a fast loading time, so that I can browse the website fast and easily, without losing interest because of the waiting time.*
  * I made sure that the website loads fast by testing the website with different tools and also by reducing the size of the images that were too big.

* *As a user, I want to see a website with warm and blending colours, with a functional and easy to use, intuitive layout.*
  * I made sure that the website has warm colours, that it feels welcoming, and there are no strong colours used. The layout is intuitive, having available 
    a navigation bar at the top of the screen. The footer is located at the bottom of the screen, social media, contact details and links are available in the footer.
    The website has visible links and buttons. The buttons have a hover effect to provide a reaction to users action.  

* *As a user, I want the website to have a consistent experience.*
  * I achieved this by using the same colours within specific sections, having specific colours for links and buttons, used one font for titles and one font for text.
    Added icons to titles for the user to easily understand what the section might be associated to.   

* *As a user, I want to feel that I can come back for new content and not be presented with the same old information.*
  * This can be achieved with the constant update of the **Suggestion of the month** section on the *Tips & Tricks page*. The *Recipes page* could also be updated regularly,
    by suggesting different cocktails and shops. The *Events page* could have new content from once in a while by updating the **Future Events** section. 

* *As a user, I want to be able to contact the team easily, if I have more questions.*
  * I made sure to add the contact details in the footer of the website. Social media links can also be found in the footer. Contact button is available on the home page header,
    to make it easily accessible for users who are looking to contact the team directly. The *Contact page* can also be found in both the header and footer.

* *As a user, I want to see a confirmation that my inquiry has been sent without any issues.*
  * On the *Contact page* I applied the data validation, to make sure users don't omit to fill out their details. Once the form has been filled and submitted, there will be 
    another page showing up, thanking the user for filling out the form. 

* *As a user, I want the website to look credible and trustworthy.*
  * I made sure to include a **Testimonials** section on the *Events page* to increase the users trust. A favicon has been added to all pages *head*. There have been included
    high quality images, made sure each section has either a picture, video or lists suggestions. Links to social media and contact are easy to find.

* *As a user, I want to see responsive buttons, so I know that an action was taken when I clicked a button.* 
  * I made sure to add shadow and hover colour change, to make sure the user will be able to see a change when an action was taken, thus being either a button or link.

* *As a user, I want to see a navigation bar that can lead to other pages.* 
  * A navigation bar has been created at the top of the website, which includes links to the other pages. The links have hover effect, so the user knows they are links when they 
    move the cursor over the text. 

* *As a user, I want to find information about the team, so I can find out more about them.*
  * I made sure to include a section called **About Us** on the *Home page* introducing the team, and their experience, together with a picture that includes both team members.

* *As a user, I want to find social media links that could lead me to other social media pages, where I can find more information and photos about ZestyTails.*
  * Social media links have been created in the footer, for the most used social media platforms. Social media presence would be included in the future features. 

* *As a user, I want to find recipes with ingredients and steps, so I can try some new cocktails at home.*
  * For users that want to improve their bartending skills, there is a section on the *Recipes page* showing cocktail suggestions, with photos, ingredients and steps explaining
    how to mix the ingredients properly.

* *As a user, I want to see suggestions that could help me become a better bartender at home.*
  * This has been achieved through the section **Basic Bar Tools To Have** on the *Tips & Tricks page*. These items are the most useful items to have as a bartender aficionado.

* *As a user, I want to see information about what type of events ZestyTails supports.*
  * On the *Events page* there is a section called **You Choose The Drinks & We Do The Rest** where it is explained the type of events that the team supports. Images have been used
    to easily give the users hints about the events supported.

  * On the *Events page* the section **Future Events** provides information about how the team can be met in person, if any user would feels more comfortable hiring them after having met
    them in person and tested one of their cocktails. 

### Test scenarios

      1. Link redirected to the homepage on all 6 pages. 

   1. Home page 'About' button: 

      1. I went to the **Home** page

      1. I went to the **Home** page, scrolled to the footer section
      1. I clicked on the *Back To Top* button, which changed colour
      1. Link redirected to the top of the page
      1. Repeated this on all 6 pages.

   1. Footer 'Menu' links:
      1. I went to the **Home** page, scrolled to the footer section 
      1. I clicked on all the links 'Home, Tips & Tricks, Recipes, Contact, Events' along the left side of the footer
      1. Links redirected to corresponding pages  
      1. Repeated this on all 6 pages.

      1. I went to the **Tips and Tricks** page, scrolled to the 'Suggestion Of The Month' section 
      1. I clicked on the 'Follow The Long Hall Pub on Twitter' button, which changed colour
      1. Link redirected to respective twitter page, opening the page in a new tab.

   1. **Recipes** page, 'Where to Buy These Ingredients' section links:
      1. I went to the **Recipes** page, scrolled to the 'Where to Buy These Ingredients' section 
      1. I clicked on each 'Find out more on their website.' links, which became underlines and bold
      1. Each link redirected to respective websites, opening the pages in new tabs.

   1. Contact form:
      1. I went to the **Contact** page, where I was able to find a contact form
      1. I tried to add in details, while leaving a box empty
      1. Clicked on the 'Submit' button
      1. A dialogue box appeared indicating that the 'required' field needed to be filled in
      1. Tried to submit the form with an invalid email address and the error ' Please include an '@' in the email address' appeared
      1. Submitted the form with all inputs valid and the form has been successfully submitted
      1. A new page appeared with a thank you message and links to the other pages. 


2. **Responsiveness**:
   
   When I created the website, I used mostly the bootstrap grid system, making sure the website remains responsive to all devices, by adding
   rows and columns to most of the websites features. 

   Features that worked well with the use of bootstrap are: 

    * **Navigation bar** - which changes layout depending on the device's screen size. On certain devices, the hamburger icon replaces the menu 
    list, and reveals an expandable menu dropdown
    * **Footer** - which changes layout depending on the device's screen size. On certain devices, the footer becomes a list, the social media
    and the logo move to the bottom of the screen, leaving more visible the menu and contact section, followed by the logo, social media and copyright. 
    * **Jumbotron** - which is the header's background image and slogan, having the About and Contact buttons on top of it. This changes layout 
    depending on the size of the device, the buttons aligning one above the other on small devices.  
    * **Websites sections and cards** - the rows and columns change location depending on the size of the screen, making it easier for the reader to 
    read the text and have the image above or below the text. Images also change size depending on the screen size.
    * **Contact form** - changes size depending on the screen size, making it easier for the user to fill out the form details.

### Bugs
  * **On Iphone8 - IOS 13.3 & Iphone XR - Safari/Chrome/Edge the background image is extra zoomed in** - it seems that IOS 
    [does not support](https://www.quirksmode.org/css/backgroundattachment.html) 'background-attachment: fixed'. I have seen plenty of workarounds on
    stackoverflow, but nothing seems like an easy fix. 
  * **Youtube video 'iframe' not showing on 24" desktop [1920x1200]** - on the home page, the video is not visible on the 24" desktop testing. If we 
    click on the location of the video this starts playing, but remains hidden. We can only see the text on the left side of the section. I have not found 
    a fix for this.
  * As mentioned above, when I validate my css code on the [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) page, there are several warnings (34),
    but these are all the changes made by [Auto-prefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to make sure the css has all prefixes it needs, in order to work 
    properly on all modern browsers. The Auto-prefixer changed mainly my header's background image styling by removing the
    ```-webkit-background-size: cover; -moz-background-size: cover; -o-background-size: cover;``` and adding other display properties. Not sure if this caused
    the error on IOS Safari afterwards.
