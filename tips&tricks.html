                 <p><strong>The Long Hall</strong> is one of the most ornated and oldest pubs in Dublin. Formerly owned by an 
                 antique collector, the pub retains a lot of the character and ornaments that the publican once crammed 
                 into this gorgeous pub. This pub was named after a chapel dedicated to Saint George in 1181. The Long Hall 
                 preserves a Victorian atmosphere evoking a by-gone age. Today, The Long Hall retains much of its old charm; 
                 on the walls are engravings of the dealings of the Russian Emperor Paul I with the Polish patriot Kosiusko,
                 as well as prints of Gainsborough ladies. The woodwork interior adds an air of authenticity to the premises. 
                 The Long Hall draws in a crowd so broad because it is warm and welcoming, treasured in history and 
                 really is in the argument to be that No.1 pint in this old town. Popular Guinness blogs Guinness Advisor 
                 (7.5/10) & Pints of Plain (8.5/10) agree.

                <p>You don't have to own each and every item listed below in order to make killer cocktails 
                    - but I find that all of these are useful items to have in your kit.
                </p>

                    <dt>Jigger or Measuring Cup</dt>
                        <dd>Jiggers are available in different measurements, but if you are going to own one, 
                            start with the classic. Alternatively, you can use a shot glass with measurement marks. 
                            Accurately measuring your ingredients is key to creating a well-balanced cocktail.
                        </dd>
                    <dt>Boston Shaker</dt>
                        <dd>This shaker is the standard one used by bartenders. using it properly can take some 
                            practice, but it's well worth the effort. The shaker consists in 2 parts: a heavy-bottomed,
                            tempered 16-ounce glass (a standard pint glass will do) and a larger stainless-steel cup 
                            (the ones I use are 28 ounces).
                        </dd>
                    <dt>Hawthorn Strainer</dt>
                        <dd>This metal strainer is used in tandem with the Boston shaker to hold back the ice you used
                            to mix your drink and any loose ingredients, such as herbs, fruit or pulp. It features two 
                            to four prongs that keep the strainer from slipping into the shaker and a flexible metal coil 
                            for a snug fit.
                        </dd>
                    <dt>Bar Spoon</dt>
                        <dd>A metal spoon that is at least 10 inches long and has a spiral handle, a bar spoon is used 
                            for stirring drinks in a glass. It also comes in handy for layering drinks (stacking spirits
                            of different densities - and often different colors - in a clear glass so you can see each
                            individual layer), adding a teaspoon of syrup or sugar, hand-cracking ice, or ladling a few 
                            drops of a cocktail you're mixing on the back of your hand to taste for balance.

                    <dt>Muddler</dt>
                        <dd>You could get away with using a wooden spoon to muddle a sugar cube, herbs, or fruit in a 
                            mixing glass, but a muddler is custom-made for this job. They come in various sizes, but most
                            look like a miniature baseball bat. The flat side is the business end of the muddler, the side
                            you use to gently mash fruits or a bitters-soaked sugar cube, bruise fresh herbs to release
                            their essential oils, or even to crush ice.

                    <dt>Juicer</dt>
                        <dd>Using fresh citrus juice is essential to making top-quality cocktails. Fresh juice doesn't keep
                            long in the refrigerator, so plan to squeeze as you go, or, if you're going to need a large 
                            quantity for a party, juice the fruit at the last minute as you prep for the event. If you want
                            to go all out, a hand-press juicer is a wonder to watch in action.
                        </dd>
                    <dt>Peeler</dt>
                        <dd>A peeler is essential for cutting strips of zest from citrus fruits without taking too much of
                            the bitter white pith with it. A Y-shaped peeler has a wider blade and can be used to cut away 
                            larger pieces of zest. 
                        </dd>
                    <dt>Zesters</dt>
                        <dd>The aforementioned zester that is a part of some channel knives produces very thin strips of zest,
                            which aren't often used in cocktails, although you might use the zester to carve a decorative
                            design into a garnish. What you actually need is a Microplane grater to zest citrus, ginger, and 
                            hard spices such as nutmeg.

                    <dt>Knives</dt>
                        <dd>A 3- to 4-inch paring knife is the right size for slicing and chopping ingredients and garnishes.
                            Kuhn Rikon makes a nonstick paring knife in a rainbow of vibrant colors. The blade is super-sharp
                            and comes with a removable plastic sheath, making it a great on-the-go knife to have on hand for 
                            picnics. You'll also want to have an 8-inch chef's knife - either classic or santoku styke - for
                            cutting larger pieces of fruit and general kitchen prep.
                        </dd>
                    <dt>Cutting Board</dt>
                        <dd>You'll need a large kitchen cutting board for basic prep tasks, especially when working with 
                            larger fruit like pineapple or melons. Hardwood is best (be sure to regularly treat it with 
                            mineral oil), but a nonporous polyethylene board will work as well. I also like to keep a small
                            wooden cutting board on hand for slicing lemons, limes, and oranges. When I'm entertaining, I 
                            leave this out at the cocktail station with a paring knife, peeler, and zester.
                        </dd>
                    <dt>Corkscrew/Bottle Opener</dt>
                        <dd>In addition to a corkscrew, the compact tool known as a "waiter's friend" also includes a bottle
                            opener and a small blade that is handy for cutting away plastic, foil, wax, or metal wrappers around
                            bottle tops. This, and the two-sided "church key" - style bottle opener - armed with a dull end on 
                            one side for opening bottles and a sharp end on the opposite side for punching holes in metal cans
                            - is all you really need.
